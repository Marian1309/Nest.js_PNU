## Example API Endpoints

Here are the endpoints provided by the Book API:

- **Create a book**: `POST [http://localhost:3000/books](http://localhost:3000/books)`
- **Get all books**: `GET [http://localhost:3000/books](http://localhost:3000/books)`
- **Get a book by ID**: `GET [http://localhost:3000/books/1](http://localhost:3000/books/1)`
- **Update a book**: `PATCH [http://localhost:3000/books/1](http://localhost:3000/books/1)`
- **Delete a book**: `DELETE [http://localhost:3000/books/1](http://localhost:3000/books/1)`

## Project Highlights

This project demonstrates how to:

1. Set up a NestJS project with Prisma ORM.
2. Define a Prisma schema for the Book model.
3. Implement CRUD operations using Prisma Client.
4. Structure a NestJS application with modules, services, and controllers.
5. Create RESTful API endpoints for managing books.

## Additional Enhancements

You can further extend this project by implementing:

- Authentication and authorization
- Validation using `class-validator` and `class-transformer`
- Swagger documentation for API exploration
- Unit and integration tests
- Pagination and filtering for the book list endpoint

This project serves as a strong foundation for building more complex applications with NestJS and Prisma ORM.
